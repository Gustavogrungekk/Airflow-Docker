When you create an AWS connection in the Airflow UI under "Admin" -> "Connections," you provide details such as the connection ID, connection type (e.g., Amazon Web Services), 
AWS region, access key, secret key, and additional parameters depending on the service.
In our case we will be sending data to AWS S3, 
ensure that your Airflow environment has AWS credentials configured.
You can do this by setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables or by using the AWS CLI or other credential management approaches.
These credentials should have the necessary permissions to interact with the S3 bucket.
